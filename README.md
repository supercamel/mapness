<h1>Mapness</h1>

<p>Mapness is a Gtk+ map widget with a focus on being roughly equivalent to
Google Maps.

<p>Mapness can source maps from OsmGpsMap, Google Maps and Virtual Earth.
<br>

Mapness has been inspired by the OsmGpsMap, but unlike OsmGpsMap it is written
in the Vala programming language. The benefits of Vala are
<ul>
    <li>faster and less tedious to develop with</li>
    <li>similar performance to C</li>
    <li>it's harder to write buggy code with</li>
    <li>generates very clean bindings with gir</li>
</ul>
